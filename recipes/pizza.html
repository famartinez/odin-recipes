    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p> Chicago-style pizza is pizza prepared according to several different styles developed in Chicago, widely referred to simply as deep dish pizza due to its cooking style. 
        The pan in which it is baked gives the pizza its characteristically high edge 
        which provides ample space for large amounts of cheese and a chunky tomato sauce. Chicago-style pizza may be prepared in deep-dish style and as a stuffed pizza.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>San Marzano tomatoes</li>
    <li>thinly sliced pepperoni</li>
    <li>mozzarella</li>
    <li>all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>active dry yeast</li>
     </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Mix sugar, yeast and 11 ounces room temperature water (about 80 degrees) in a bowl and let bloom for 15 minutes. Combine flour, 
        salt and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Once yeast has bloomed, add to dry ingredients along with corn oil. Gently combine with a rubber spatula until a rough ball is formed.</li>
    <li>Knead on low speed with the dough hook for 90 seconds. Transfer to a lightly oiled bowl and proof until doubled in size, about 6 hours. Punch down and let dough settle for 15 more minutes.</li>
    <li>Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. </li>
    <li>Coat bottom and sides of a 12-inch cake pan or traditional Chicago style pizza pan with melted butter. 
        Using your hands, spread out about three-quarters of the dough across the bottom and up the sides of the pan (save the remainder for another use). 
        Cover entire bottom in mozzarella, all the way up to the edge. Cover half with a thin, even layer of raw sausage. Cover the other half with the pepperoni. 
        Top with a couple handfuls of crushed tomatoes. Spread out with hands to the edge. Sprinkle top evenly with grated Parm. </li>
    <li>Bake, rotating halfway through, until golden around the edge, about 25 minutes. Let rest for about 5 minutes, 
        then either gently lift pizza out of pan or just cut your slice out of the pan like a pie! </li>
    </ol>
