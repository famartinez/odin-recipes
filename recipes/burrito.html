    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p> A burrito is a dish in Mexican and 
        Tex-Mex cuisine that took form in California cuisine, consisting of a flour tortilla wrapped into a sealed cylindrical shape around various ingredients.
        The tortilla is sometimes lightly grilled or steamed to soften it, make it more pliable, and allow it to adhere to itself. Burritos are often eaten by hand, 
        as their tight wrapping keeps the ingredients together. Burritos can also be served "wet", i.e., covered in a savory and spicy sauce, when they would be eaten with a fork and knife.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>lean ground beef</li>
    <li>taco seasoning mix</li>
    <li>refried beans</li>
    <li>flour tortillas</li>
    <li>cooked rice</li>
    <li>pico de gallo</li>
     </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350° F. Spray 9 x 13-inch baking dish with cooking spray and set aside.</li>
    <li>Cook beef with taco seasoning mix, according to seasoning package instructions.</li>
    <li>To prepare 1 burrito: spread ¼ cup beans down center of tortillas; top with ½ cup rice, beef, 2 tablespoons corn, and ¼ cup cheese. </li>
    <li>Fold in opposite sides of each tortilla, then roll up, burrito style. Place, seam-sides down, in prepared dish. Repeat with remaining ingredients to prepare 6 total burritos.</li>
